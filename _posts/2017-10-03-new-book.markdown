Our book "Serverless Applications with Node.js" is now available as a MEAP release on Manning Publication website.

<a class="no-style-link" href="/book"><img src="/img/effortless-serverless-social.png" alt="Serverless Applications with Node.js"></a>

The book walks you through building serverless apps on AWS using JavaScript. Inside, you’ll create a full project designed to help you understand and apply general serverless design principles and concepts.

Along the way, you’ll also discover what Claudia brings to the table as you build and deploy a scalable event-based serverless application that is fully integrated with AWS services including Lambda and API Gateway.

You’ll learn to simplify the design and development process so you can focus on getting your application deployed as fast as possible without sacrificing quality.

Plus, you’ll learn how to migrate your existing Express apps to serverless!
