Aleksandar Simovic is a Senior Software Engineer at [Science Exchange](https://www.scienceexchange.com/) and co-author of [“Serverless Applications with Node.js”](https://www.manning.com/books/serverless-applications-with-nodejs) with Slobodan Stojanović, published by Manning Publications. Additionally, he writes on [Medium](https://medium.com/@simalexan) on both business and technical aspects of serverless. He's also a Wardley Mapper.

Aleksandar is a [Claudia.js](https://claudiajs.com/) core team member, and is also involved with other serverless related open-source projects such as Claudia-Bot-Builder, Scotty.js, and [Desole.io](https://desole.io/). He has published over a dozen open-source serverless applications to the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/). One of his latest serverless experiments is a Serverless JARVIS, an Alexa skill that can create serverless applications using voice commands. [See Aleksandar's serverless apps in the Repository](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications?query=Aleksandar%20Simovic).
